ISO 15765-2, or ISO-TP, is an international standard for sending data packets over a CAN-Bus. The protocol allows for the transport of messages that exceed the eight byte maximum payload of CAN frames. ISO-TP segments longer messages into multiple frames, adding metadata that allows the interpretation of individual frames and reassembly into a complete message packet by the recipient. It can carry up to 4095 bytes of payload per message packet.
